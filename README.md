Problem Statement 2: 
The college bookstore tells prospective students that the average cost of its  textbooks is Rs. 52 with a standard deviation of Rs. 4.50. A group of smart statistics  students thinks that the average cost is higher. To test the bookstore’s claim against  their alternative, the students will select a random sample of size 100. Assume that  the mean from their random sample is Rs. 52.80. Perform a hypothesis test at the  5% level of significance and state your decision. 
Problem Statement 3:  
A certain chemical pollutant in the Genesee River has been constant for several  years with mean μ = 34 ppm (parts per million) and standard deviation σ = 8 ppm. A  group of factory representatives whose companies discharge liquids into the river is  now claiming that they have lowered the average with improved filtration devices. A  group of environmentalists will test to see if this is true at the 1% level of  significance. Assume \ that their sample of size 50 gives a mean of 32.5 ppm.  Perform a hypothesis test at the 1% level of significance and state your decision. 
Problem Statement 4:  
Based on population figures and other general information on the U.S. population,  suppose it has been estimated that, on average, a family of four in the U.S. spends  about $1135 annually on dental expenditures. Suppose further that a regional dental  association wants to test to determine if this figure is accurate for their area of  country. To test this, 22 families of 4 are randomly selected from the population in  that area of the country and a log is kept of the family’s dental expenditure for one  year. The resulting data are given below. Assuming, that dental expenditure is  normally distributed in the population, use the data and an alpha of 0.5 to test the  dental association’s hypothesis.

Problem Statement 5:  
In a report prepared by the Economic Research Department of a major bank the  Department manager maintains that the average annual family income on Metropolis  is $48,432. What do you conclude about the validity of the report if a random sample  of 400 families shows and average income of $48,574 with a standard deviation of  2000? 
Problem Statement 6: 
Suppose that in past years the average price per square foot for warehouses in the  United States has been $32.28. A national real estate investor wants to determine  whether that figure has changed now. The investor hires a researcher who randomly  samples 19 warehouses that are for sale across the United States and finds that the  mean price per square foot is $31.67, with a standard deviation of $1.29. assume  that the prices of warehouse footage are normally distributed in population. If the  researcher uses a 5% level of significance, what statistical conclusion can be  reached? What are the hypotheses?

Problem Statement 9: 
Find the t-score below which we can expect 99% of sample means will fall if samples  of size 16 are taken from a normally distributed population.
Problem Statement 10:  
If a random sample of size 25 drawn from a normal population gives a mean of 60  and a standard deviation of 4, find the range of t-scores where we can expect to find  the middle 95% of all sample means. Compute the probability that (−��0.05 <��<��0.10).

In a certain town, there are about one million eligible voters. A simple random  sample of 10,000 eligible voters was chosen to study the relationship between  gender and participation in the last election. The results are summarized in the  following 2X2 (read two by two) contingency table: 

We would want to check whether being a man or a woman (columns) is independent of  having voted in the last election (rows). In other words, is “gender and voting independent”?

Each respondent in the Current Population Survey of March 1993 was classified as  employed, unemployed, or outside the labor force. The results for men in California age 35- 44 can be cross-tabulated by marital status, as follows:

Men of different marital status seem to have different distributions of labor force status. Or is  this just chance variation? (you may assume the table results from a simple random  sample.)
